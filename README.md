## This implements ResNet with one-neuron hidden layers is a Universal Approximator. [`arxiv`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10909)

### Results:

- With 2, 3 resnet blocks the classification is unstable. However, by changing learning rates dynamically, we might achieve a better classification  
TODO: add dynamic learning rates 
- Adding more resnet blocks decreased loss
TODO: use different classification tasks.
